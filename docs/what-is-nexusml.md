# What is NexusML?

NexusML is a powerful AutoML platform designed for developers who want to train AI models for various classification 
or regression tasks without the need for technical knowledge in Machine Learning (ML). Based on a data-centric 
approach, NexusML allows users to focus on training data management, abstracting away the complexities of ML 
algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.

NexusML supports multimodal AI models that can handle multiple types of data, such as images, documents, audio, time 
series, and databases.

## Key Features

- **Data-Centric Approach**: Enables developers to concentrate solely on training data management without worrying 
  about the complexities of ML.
- **Multimodal AI**: Capable of handling structured and unstructured data of different types, including images, 
  documents, audio, time series, and databases.
- **Predictive Tasks**: Specializes in classification and regression tasks, making it ideal for cost-effective, 
  non-generative AI applications.
- **Complex Task Schemas**: Supports multi-input/multi-output predictive tasks, with no restrictions on input data type.
- **Whole ML Lifecycle**: Covers the entire ML lifecycle though multiple services that specialize in different stages:
    - *Inference Service*: Deploys and serves AI models in production environments.
    - *Continual Learning Service*: Updates and retrains AI models with new data.
    - *Active Learning Service*: Proactively selects the most informative data samples encountered in production for 
      human labeling.
    - *Monitoring Service*: Detects anomalies in the AI model behavior.
